- 👋 Hi, I’m @Butnmsher and I consider myself a junior programmer.
- 👀 I’m interested in html, css, javascript, php, and in general basic web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic website design and project management skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of yet.
- 📫 How to reach me... umm is there messaging through github? if not well, no messages for now.
